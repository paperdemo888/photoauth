# Zoom Privacy Demo
## Video conference demo 1
#### This is a multi-participant online video conference with a host and multiple participants. The video includes scenarios such as switching back and forth between grid view and speaker view, virtual backgrounds, and shared desktops.
#### The goal is that except for the host user, all others are privacy-sensitive users, we need to protect their faces and voices, the system uses the white list model, that is, the white list has only the host userâ€˜s face information and voice information.
#### [Original video download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperdemo888/zoom_privacy/master/demo1/original.mp4 "Original video")
#### The result after processing by our system.

#### At the 25th second, due to the privacy-sensitive user's head twisting at too large an angle to recognize the face, we execute the patch system to protect the missed face.
